# Beans-Away-
Beans Away! A small game jam bomber game.

Just a prewarning this was made in 2 days for the Jame Gam #29(4 day game jam but made in 2 days) so, it features a fair amount of jankyness and programmer graphics but I will be polishing it and fixing it after this initial release.

There is a simple tutorial level of learning to fly through checkpoints to another airbase to get used to the controls, other levels may be added in the future.

#Controls:
Space and Ctrl for throttle increase and decrease.
S and W for control of the pitch of the aircraft (Up and Down)
A and D for controlling rolling of the aircraft (Left and Right)
Right click to drop bombs which reload after 2 seconds
